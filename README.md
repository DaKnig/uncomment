# uncomment
a tool for removing C-style comments
removes single-line comments starting with (//) or (;) and multi-line comments enclosed in (/* */)

motivation- I was writing some asm code and thought I would really like multi-line comments... sadly this wasnt present so I made this tool.

I would really appreciate testing and bug reports (if I could find how it works here...)
