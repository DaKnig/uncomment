# uncomment
a tool for removing C-style comments
removes single-line comments starting with (//) or (;) and multi-line comments enclosed in (/* */)

motivation- I was writing some asm code and thought I would really like multi-line comments... sadly this wasnt present so I made this tool.

I would really appreciate testing and bug reports (if I could find how it works here...)

compiled with gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 with default settings

the provided "exe" file is a precompiled version for 64-bit linux (works on my ubuntu setup)
